Will post all the code on the weekend. Still not sure if I should add the SMS sending functionality by default. Because the RN modules are not very stable and I basically made my own and reprogrammed the entire app in Kotlin as well. So thinking of a community and enterprise version.  

People would still be able to download and query the Large Language Models for information with the community version. 

The devs can figure it out themselves and I was thinking of doing a sort of enterprise version on Google Play Store but it's hard to make things highly customised in terms of the UI even app name, icon and such.

Therefore not exactly sure how to distribute it if I commercialize it so I'll see I'll probably open source the entire thing.
